# Fresh Jobs Data Modeling

## Description

Model the data that backs a job board site

## Explorer Mode

* Diagram out the data models for the [job board website](https://github.com/TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering/fresh-job-board-views) you made components for yesterday. You should have at least three models (maybe more) and each model should include:

> * It's relationship to the other models (one to one, one to many, many to many, or no relationship)
> * The attributes in the model. Each attribute should include:
> 	* a name
> 	* default value
> 	* data type
> 	* whether or not it is required (can it be left emtpy?)

If you draw this out by hand, take a photo of your work for submission. If you use a computer to draw it, save the file in a pdf format.

##### Notes

> [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) is a tool you can use to draw flow charts and data trees

##### What to submit

* A link to your file, which should be added to your fresh jobs repo from yesterday
